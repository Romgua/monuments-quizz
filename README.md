## How it works ?

The Monuments Quiz application is a website which aims to *test the user's knowledge of world monuments* and their cities.

The game system is based on a point system which **rewards risk taking**. On a series of **10 questions**, the user will be asked to choose, for each question, a response mode in order to identify the city of the monument displayed on the screen.

The different choice modes and the number of points rewarded are described below:

| Modes of choice | Number of points | Number of proposed responses |
| - | - | - |
| Duo | +1 point | 2 suggested responses |
| Carr√©| +3 points | 4 suggested responses |
| Cash | +5 points | No response proposal |

### Features

The user can **play for free** and without creating an account.
However, it is strongly advised to create an account that will allow him to store his statistics and compare them with his friends. 

### Future improvements

In future versions, accounts may allow you to check game history, use wild cards shared on the game.
A difficulty system based on the displayed monument will also be implemented.
